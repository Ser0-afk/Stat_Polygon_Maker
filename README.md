# Stat Polygon Maker
A simple and customizable custom stat polygon maker, like the ones you find in many videogames or role playing stat blocks.

It just needs the .exe file, but you can also find the source code in the folder (it's a Godot project).
You can edit the config file and find the saved images in AppData\Roaming\Godot\app_userdata\Stat Polygon Maker

To chenge the colors, use the format Color(red, green, blue, alpha) with values between 0 and 1, where the last value is the transparency (set 0 to have a color be fully transparent).
R is the radius of the circumscribing circle.
AA is for antialiasing in the drawn lines.

Have a good one.
