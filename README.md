# Stat Polygon Maker
A simple and customizable custom stat polygon maker, like the ones you find in many videogames or role playing stat blocks, made with Godot.

You can edit the config file and find the saved images in AppData\Roaming\Godot\app_userdata\Stat Polygon Maker

To change the colors, use the format Color(red, green, blue, alpha) with values between 0 and 1, where the last value is the transparency (set 0 to have a color be fully transparent).
R is the radius of the circumscribing circle.
AA is for antialiasing in the drawn lines.

Have a good one.
