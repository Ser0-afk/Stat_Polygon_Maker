# Stat-Polygon-Maker
Source code for a custom stat polygon maker, like the ones you find in many videogames or role playing stat blocks.

For now it needs to be imported in the Godot engine to work.
You can find the configs in Image.gd and the saved image in the output folder.
It can only save one image at a time, so if you want to save multiples you need to move them each time to another folder.

I plan to make it able to save multiple images, have a standalone config file and eventualy release a exe independent from the engine.

Have a good one.
